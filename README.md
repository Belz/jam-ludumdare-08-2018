# Mindlapse
*Some people say that the mind is a palace — reality has other ideas.*

Battle against the monsters in your mind as they slowly erode your sanity, but watch out — the longer you fight, the more damage your mind takes. Do your best to hold it together or you'll soon find yourself with no mind at all.
